## Getting Started

To use this landing page template, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jocko010/Basic-landing-page.git
   ```
2. Customize the content:

Replace the logo image in the header section with your own logo.
Modify the text, images, and links in the hero and features sections to match your product or service.

3. Customize the styles:

Modify the styles.css file to change the colors, fonts, and other styles according to your preference.
Update the images in the img folder with your own images.

4. Set up the dark mode preference:

In the script.js file, you can customize the behavior of the dark mode toggle button.
By default, the user's preference for dark mode is stored in the browser's localStorage and applied upon page load. You can modify this behavior or add additional functionality as needed.

5. Host the landing page:

Upload the modified code to your hosting provider or server.
Ensure that all the necessary files (HTML, CSS, images, and JavaScript) are included.
